John Old, Napier University, Edinburgh,  from MICRA's contributed eBook of Roget's Thesaurus (Project Gutenberg's  #22).        ROGET'S THESAURUS  OF  ENGLISH WORDS AND PHRASES    Notes on the automatically-generated Index to Roget's Thesaurus,  1911 edition.    Introduction A true Roget's Thesaurus (as opposed to an  alphabetically-listed synonym dictionary) is composed of three parts:    - a hierarchical classification structure (hierarchy or "Synopsis of    Categories");    - a body, which lists the Categories (whose titles are sometimes  referred to as "head words" or "headings"), under which are found the  groups of semantically- or conceptually-related words and phrases  (also called synonyms or entries);    - and an Index that lists the entries alphabetically (along with the  Category titles and numbers under which the entry may be found in the  body).    This document contains the complete Index to the 1911 (American)  edition. It was generated from the entries (synonyms, phrases and word  lists) contained in the Gutenburg/MICRA free E- text thesaurus 14a  (plain text version). It is larger than the original 1911 Roget's  Thesaurus Index, containing all text entries (i.e. excluding numbers,  special characters and parenthetical information) up to 25 characters  long (91,000+ entries).    Index Entries This Index lacks the intelligence found in the original  hand-edited Index, where common-sense aggregations occur. For example  A B C and A.B.C. are found under a single Index entry in the original  Index. Also, phrases are here listed alphabetically rather than  "semantically." For example, in the original Index under the Index  entry home there are phrases such as be at -, at - with, bring to  ("be at home," "at home with," " bring home to"). In this  automatically-generated Index be at home is instead listed after the  entry be at cross purposes with and before the entries be at home in,  and be at home with; while bring home to is listed after bring  i.e. none are listed under home.    This Index includes archaic and obsolete words; foreign terms; Latin  quotations; and many other such entries that the average  thesaurus-user would never need, and were not included in the original  Index.    Foreign characters such as umlaut, circumflex, grave or acute may be  found to encoded using ASCII characters e.g. flamb_ee, b=ete noire. A  look-up for these codes is not provided.    Pages: There are 565 pages in this document (including this page) in  four-column format (one column in the plain text file). The 1911  Roget's Thesaurus (large print edition) begins at page 351 and ends at  page 653 (302 pages) in four-column format.    Header Page: I have included the original Roget's header page to the  Index (with its explanatory note) for completeness. However the  information it gives is not accurate for this automatically- generated  Index i.e., for words or phrases that are both an Index entry and one  of the Category names ("headings") listed beneath it, the reference  number is not printed in bold-face type.    L John Old  Napier University  Edinburgh  March 2003      INDEX    N.B. The numbers refer to the headings under which the words or  phrases occur.  When the same word or phrase may be used in various  senses, several headings under which it, or its synonyms, will be  found, according to those meanings, are indicated by the words printed  in Italics.  These words in Italics are not intended to explain the  meaning of the word or phrase to which they are annexed, but only to  assist in the required reference.    When a number or word of reference is placed within parentheses, the  actual word or phrase will not be found under the heading referred to,  although it may sometimes be useful to consult the category thus  indicated.    When the word given in the Index is itself the title or heading of the  category, the number of reference is printed in bold-face type, thus:  abode 186.
